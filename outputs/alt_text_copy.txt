A bathymetric map of the HICEAS study area and the planned transect lines. The U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding the Hawaiian archipelago (study area) is marked with a white boundary line and planned transect lines are in thin black lines. The Papah훮naumoku훮kea Marine National Monument area is shaded in white. The transect lines run lengthwise from northwest to the southeast of the EEZ. This map image will be updated to include actual survey effort (shown by a thick, non-black colored lines) and cetacean sightings (shown by colored shapes).
