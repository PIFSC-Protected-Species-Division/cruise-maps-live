The idea for these live maps and this repository was inspired by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's live survey maps. The code and outputs presented here are modified from the AFSC team's [survey-live-temperature-map](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/survey-live-temperature-map) repository.

## Purpose

The Hawaiian Islands Cetacean and Ecosystem Survey (HICEAS) assesses whale, dolphin, and seabird populations across the Hawaiian Islands. The survey is conducted by NOAA Fisheries' Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. The code in this repository allows us to generate summary maps and tables of our survey progress and cetacean sightings. These scripts compile the various data streams, collected and uploaded to Google Drive by the researchers at sea, and then create daily maps and an up-to-date summary table. The generated map and table are shared to the cruise website.

## Notes

[How to set up automation using Windows Task Scheduler](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSvKQl3RGqqxyt8O07Qfya14hhlKR16bmz8MlNiHDQ8/edit) This includes information on setting up the Windows Task Scheduler to execute an R script on a schedule (in our case `run.r`) and to autocommit and push changes to GitHub. 

Where the input and output files will be saved: [Google Drive - Restricted access](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1okUHW9LRxXJ8T8Djxu_VUKV3LPmEMp6c)

When running the `run.R` script for the first time on your local machine, first run the `prep.R` script to ensure the folder structure is set up properly and all necessary packages are installed.

To re-run a day (perhaps the DAS was updated/corrected), use the `das_reRunPrep.R` script. This will remove previous entries for this date from the compiled data outputs and the `dasList` record of which das have been successfully processed. After cleaning those up, the full `run.R` script can be re-run and the latest copy of those DAS files will be downloaded and processed.

To re-run all days, delete the `dasList*.Rda` file from the 'outputs' folder and all the `compiled*.Rda` files from the 'data' folder (e.g., `compiledDetections_OES2303.Rda`). 

## Plot Examples

As each survey leg completes we will share some example plots and gifs here! 

### Blank, pre-survey base map

## Suggestions and Comments

If you see that the data, product, or metadata can be improved, you are invited to create a 
[pull request](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/cruise-maps-live/pulls), or
[submit an issue to this repository](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/cruise-maps-live/issues)

If you notice the map has not been updated in a few days, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/cruise-maps-live/issues). Sometimes that can happen if our processing computer reboots or there is an authentication issue. We will see the issue and check it out!
